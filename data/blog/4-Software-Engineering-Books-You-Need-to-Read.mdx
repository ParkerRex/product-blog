## 1. [Shape Up: Stop Running in Circles and Ship Work that Matters](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)

From the author:

"Shape Up is for product development teams who struggle to ship. If you’ve thought to yourself “Why can’t we ship like we used to?” or “I never have enough time to think about strategy,” then this book can help. You’ll learn language and techniques to define focused projects, address unknowns, and increase collaboration and engagement within your team."

Taking an idea from something in your head and turning it into reality where people are actually using it and transacting on it is a THING. There are thousands of microdecisions you have to make along the way.

[Shape up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup) is the best obok for taking those abstract ideas and turning them into actionable steps for your team.

## 3. [Sacred 7 - The Skills Required to Crush Product Manager Interviews and be a World-Class PM](https://www.amazon.com/Product-Managements-Sacred-Seven-World-Class/dp/0578740583)

This book is giant but has a lot of great content in it.

Sections include:

- Product Design
- Economics
- Psychology
- User experience (UX)
- Data Science
- Law & Policy
- Marketing and Growth

Some of my highlights:

- "What makes a great product manager?... a strong grasp of business strategy, soft skills and leadership ability, vision, analytical skills, product sense, and a dash of entrepreneurial mojo".
- "You can't build a great product without understanding how the human mind works; you can't sell products without knowing the science of marketing and growth;"
- "0-1 is about building toward product-market fit, while 1-to-N is about scaling."
- "If you can't validate your assumptions, you'll never be sure if your product has a realistic shot at success."
- "Metrics aren't always law"

## 4. [Inspired by Marty Cagan](https://svpg.com/inspired-how-to-create-products-customers-love/)

- GO to product recommendation book
- Tons of actionable insight.

Sections include

- Lessons from Top Tech Companies
- The Right People
- The Right Product
- The Right Process
- The Right Culture

Some of my highlights:

- "The first truth is that at least half of our ideas are just not going to work"
- "The MVP should be a prototype, not a product"
- "Minimum size for a product team is usually two engineers and a product manager"
