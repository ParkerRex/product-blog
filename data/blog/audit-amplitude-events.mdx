summary: Amplitude tracking can be time consuming to setup. Make sure you do it right using this chrome extension.

_disclaimer: this assumes you have a basic understanding of amplitude instrumentation. You need to have a basic event taxonomy setup and in place before testing this._

# Why it matters..

If you're building without recording.. whats the point.

You're flying blind.

You need to track every event that a user takes. 

Maybe you got [Amplitude](https://www.amplitude.com) just now, or you're trying to learn about it. Congrats! I recently paid a company $30,000 to do this for me.

I'd rather save you the money and show you how to do double check your events.


# Download the Amplitude Chrome extension and Pin it!

1. Go to [this link](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/amplitude)
2. Download it!
3. Pin it to your Browser

<div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    <Image alt="chrome store" src="/static/images/amplitude/chrome-store.png" width={700} height={500} />
</div>

<div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    <Image alt="google extension" src="/static/images/amplitude/google-extension.png" width={300} height={500} />
</div>

# Start Testing!
1. Click thru user flows
2. Notice the amplitude event tool tracking
3. Take note of whats working and whats not.

<div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
    <Image alt="Event explorer" src="/static/images/amplitude/event-explorer.png" width={400} height={500} />
</div>


This exercise should take a few hours based on how many events you have in place. 

I hope this helps!
