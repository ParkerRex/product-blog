## The Old Way

I used to have to 
1. Go to QuickTime
2. Record a video to .mov or .mp4
3. Open up the file in Photoshop
4. Convert it to frames
5. Export as web legacy file.

## The New Way

1. Download [Giphy Capture](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/giphy-capture-the-gif-maker/id668208984?mt=12)
2. Open it up
3. Drag the frame around what you want to create a gif for

That's it.

If that wasn't helpful, watch the vid I made below.
