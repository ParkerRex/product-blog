Today is a quick explainer on how to use [Roam Research’s](https://roamresearch.com) new feature called templates.

Its really good if you have a dialy prompt or for metadata.

You used to have to create your own page and reference it.

They just released it on December 30th.

Jump into roam and open roam/templates as it’s own page. This is very similar to the roam/css page when in use for themes.

Here is the email from the founder:

<div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
  <Image alt="Roadmap" src="/static/images/roam-email.png" width={674} height={200} />
</div>

As you can see that you’re just referencing whatever you put into the roam templating page. This is super similar to using a text expander.

All you need to do is go to `roam/templates`, and type in whatever it is that you want to use as a prompt.

<div className="my-1 px-2 w-full overflow-hidden xl:my-1 xl:px-2 xl:w-1/2">
  <Image alt="Roadmap" src="/static/images/roam-template.png" width={575} height={458} />
</div>

Next all you need to do is press `;;` to bring up all the triggers for templates. As you can see it auto suggests the templates that you have.

That’s it.

To recap

- Go to roam/templates
- Create a block for whatever you want to use as a template
- Reference the template on any page using `;;`

It’s amazing to see how quickly Roam Research iterates. Thats got to be a great way they built community.
