## OH NO. Another COURSE!

Yeah thats what I think when I see someone launching a course. It makes me cringe- but I had a lot of people ask for it, and I have some free time over the next few weeks so why not give poeple what they want!

It's not set in stone (the curriculum) however I think the following topics make sense. 

- Current Topics:
- Pm Mindset
- Types of PM
- How do Products get Built
- Tools & Skillset
- Frameworks
- How to come up with new work
- Design for PM's 
- Development for PM's
- Implementing your Product work
- How to work with analytics
- Whats next
