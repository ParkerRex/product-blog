## On Writing Well by William Zinsser

Being able to communicate your ideas to an audience is key in your journey to getting more done for less.
Whether its:

- an email
- a piece of copy for a landing page
- a tiktok caption
- scripting a video
- or asking for a raise.

In the book he talks about the process of writing and rewriting. William gives the readers a process for writing more effectively. My favorite quote is "no matter the job, no matter the level, be yourself when you write."
